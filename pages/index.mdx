**Some things about me:**

I'm an Astrophysicist turned Data scientist – I like transformative ideas, art, films and technologies that will make Earth a better place and reconnect us with the more-than-human world. 
I am currently working as a Data Scientist and Project manager in high spirited data sciene and AI consulting & research company in Munich.

Here you'll mostly find:
- posts on whatever I am making and learning
- On substack, you can find my essays and write-ups

**some more things ...**

I graduated with a Master's in Astrophysics from the University of Bonn in 2019 and after a short span of existential crisis and a spark of vision to build a space start-up, I did another Master in Space Exploration and Development Systems 
from Politecnico di Torino graduating in 2020.

**Some things I'm interested in (2025):**

- My family and friends. I love them.
- Writing–it transforms me; it lets me get closer to ideas I'd otherwise only scratch the surface of.
- Cooking (meditative) especially South Indian, Italian and fusion of both.
- Brain storming scripts for my short film
- Art, mostly painting, sketching, poster designs, and I make my own t-shirts. 
- Technology, AI safety and ethics
- Entrepreneurship 
- I like to read science fiction, non-fiction and philosophy. Right now I am reading Byung-Chul Han and Zen.
- Psychedelics. They combine some of my long-term interests  - conciousness, self, intelligence, consciousness, philosophy. I believe psychedelic experiences open us up to a wider spectrum of consciousness and shake our belief in solids truths and fixed accounts of reality
- reading books 
- I watch a lot of movies. Some characters and stories shaped my thoughts and being. I owe some to it (you can find all the films I watch on letterboxd)
