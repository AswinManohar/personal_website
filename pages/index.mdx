**Some things about me:**

I’m an Astrophysicist turned Data scientist – in the constant prusit for transformative ideas and technologies that will make earth a better place and I like engaging and learning
them. Currently working on some kooky personal projects involving machine learning and generative AI. I plan to share these projects here, along with my thoughts on the human condition, science, sustainability, and space, as well as daily reflections.

**some more things ...**


I earned my Master’s in Astrophysics from the University of Bonn in 2019 and further specialized with a Master's in Space Exploration and Development Systems 
from Politecnico di Torino, graduating in 2020. Between 2020-2024, I worked with crappy datasets to pretty ones, modelling, visualizing, deriving insights and developing solutions for pressing problems focused on SDG goals.
Now I work full-time as a Research data scientist in Munich, Germany, focused on ML,DL and applying them to image datasets.

**Some things I'm interested in:**

- My wife, family and friends. I love them.
- Cooking, especially South Indian, Italian and fusion of both.
- Entrepreneurship and how businesses grow (I want to build my own company..in ideation)
- Theories about psychological and philosophical development - behavioral economics
- Neuroscience & psychedelics. They combine most of my biggest interests  - self, intelligence, consciousness, philosophy. I believe psychedelic experiences open us up to a wider spectrum of consciousness and shake our belief in solids truths and fixed accounts of reality
- I consume a lot of movies, podcasts and books. I believe it's as important to listen and learn from others as it is to contribute and give back.
