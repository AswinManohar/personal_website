**Some things about me:**

I’m an Astrophysicist turned Data scientist – currently on a prusit for transformative ideas and technologies that will make earth a better place and reconnect us with the more-than-human world. Honestly, I am not sure how I can define it yet, but I think I am working towards a better understanding of our sorroundings and what it means to be one with it. _Yup, let's move on!_
These days I am working on some kooky machine learning and generative AI side projects. I plan to share these projects here, along with my thoughts on the human condition, science, sustainability, and space, as well as daily reflections.

Here you'll mostly find:
- posts on whatever I am building
- art and stuff
- Essays and write-ups

**some more things ...**


I earned my Master’s in Astrophysics from the University of Bonn in 2019 and a specialized Master's in Space Exploration and Development Systems 
from Politecnico di Torino, graduating in 2020. Between 2020-2024, I've worked with crappy to pretentioulsy pretty datasets, modelling; visualizing, developing solutions for pressing problems focused on SDG (Sustainable Development Goals). Now I work full-time as a Research data scientist in Germany, focused on applying machine‑learning and deep‑learning methods to satellite images and whatever data that demands it. Yeah, turning messy signals—be it radio waves or satellite pixels—into insights to tackle climate change.

**Some things I'm interested in (2025):**

- My wife, family and friends. I love them.
- Writing–it transforms me; it lets me get closer to ideas I’d otherwise only scratch the surface of.
- Cooking (meditative) especially South Indian, Italian and fusion of both.
- All things that reduces carbon footprint
- Laido
- Art history
- Technology and AI safety 
- Entrepreneurship (I want to build my own company..in ideation)
- Finding a balance between existentialism and Zen philosophy
- Neuroscience & psychedelics. They combine some of my biggest interests  - conciousness, self, intelligence, consciousness, philosophy. I believe psychedelic experiences open us up to a wider spectrum of consciousness and shake our belief in solids truths and fixed accounts of reality
- reading books 
- I watch a lot of movies. Some characters and stories shaped my thoughts and being. I owe some to it (you can find all the films I've watch on letterboxd)
- Making my own film
