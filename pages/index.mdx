**Some things about me:**

I'm an Astrophysicist turned Data scientist – I like transformative ideas and technologies that will make Earth a better place and reconnect us with the more-than-human world (and maybe help us chat better with trees and robots alike).
These days I am learning more about ML, DL, LLMs, RL  and working on side projects in the intersection of ML, AI and design.

Here you'll mostly find:
- posts on whatever I am building
- side projects
- Essays and write-ups on human condition, science, philosophy, sustainability, space, and whatever deep existential thoughts that pop up

**some more things ...**


I earned my Master's in Astrophysics from the University of Bonn in 2019 and a specialized Master's in Space Exploration and Development Systems 
from Politecnico di Torino, graduating in 2020. Currently, I'm a Research Data Scientist in Germany, applying ML and DL techniques to develop sustainability targetted solutions.

**Some things I'm interested in (2025):**

- My wife, family and friends. I love them.
- Writing–it transforms me; it lets me get closer to ideas I'd otherwise only scratch the surface of.
- Cooking (meditative) especially South Indian, Italian and fusion of both.
- All things that reduces carbon footprint
- Art history
- Technology, AI safety and ethics
- Entrepreneurship (I want to build a startup..in ideation)
- Finding a balance between existentialism and Zen philosophy
- Neuroscience & psychedelics. They combine some of my biggest interests  - conciousness, self, intelligence, consciousness, philosophy. I believe psychedelic experiences open us up to a wider spectrum of consciousness and shake our belief in solids truths and fixed accounts of reality
- reading books 
- I watch a lot of movies. Some characters and stories shaped my thoughts and being. I owe some to it (you can find all the films I've watch on letterboxd)
