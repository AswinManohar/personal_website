# Hi, I'm Aswin

I am a Creative and a Data Scientist.

I make things: projects, ideas, writing, and filmmaking. 

I care about art (anything that makes you feel something that you can personally connect with), films, technology, and transformative ideas that attempt to make Earth a better place.

Lately, that means thinking a lot about the more-than-human world: the plants, animals, and systems we depend on but rarely notice.

I’m also a quite nice guy, statistically speaking. The data is inconclusive, but promising.

I am currently working as a Data Scientist and Project manager in a [frontier AI start-up & research company](https://omegalambdatec.com/en/) in Munich, Germany.


Here you'll mostly find:

- Posts on whatever I am making and learning
- On substack, you can find my essays and write-ups

### Career

I started in Astrophysics (University of Bonn) and Space Systems (Politecnico di Torino), then rerouted during COVID toward data science as a more immediate way to turn my curiosity into impact. For five years, I’ve worked on developing ML solutions involving images, remote sensing, and time-series data

### Currently

Exploring large language models and agentic systems, building a personal finance management app, and writing a script for my first film.
Stay tuned. Or don’t. The universe is expanding either way.

### Interests (2025)

- my family and friends. I love them.
- writing–it transforms me; it lets me get closer to ideas I'd otherwise only scratch the surface of.
- cooking (meditative) especially South Indian, Italian and fusion of both.
- brain storming scripts for my short film
- art, mostly painting, sketching, poster designs, and I make my own t-shirts. 
- technology, AI safety and ethics
- entrepreneurship 
- I like to read science fiction, non-fiction and philosophy. Right now I am reading Byung-Chul Han and Zen.
- psychedelics. They combine some of my long-term interests  - conciousness, self, intelligence, consciousness, philosophy. I believe psychedelic experiences open us up to a wider spectrum of consciousness and shake our belief in solids truths and fixed accounts of reality
- reading books 
- I watch a lot of movies. Some characters and stories shaped my thoughts and being. I owe some to it (you can find all the films I watch on letterboxd)
