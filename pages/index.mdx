**Some things about me:**

I am Aswin. I am a quite nice guy, statistically speaking. I like to make things. I like transformative ideas, art, films, technologies and pretty much anything that will make earth a better place and reconnect us with the more-than-human world (the non-human neighbors we tend to forget about).
I am currently working as a Data Scientist and Project manager in high spirited a AI start-up & research company in Munich, Germany.

Here you'll mostly find:

- Posts on whatever I am making and learning
- On substack, you can find my essays and write-ups

**some background ...**

After completing an M.Sc. in Astrophysics at the University of Bonn (2019) and a second M.Sc. in Space Exploration and Development Systems at Politecnico di Torino (2020), I went through a short period of reflection during the covid time that led me to combine my curiosity about astronomy and space science with practical problem-solving skills. 

I’ve been a Data Scientist for the last 5 years, and I enjoy building ML models and extracting insights from naughty datasets. Honestly, it felt like the most direct way to put my skills to work and create impact, and it’s genuinely fun. I still enjoy it. I primarily work with image and remote-sensing datasets, computer vision, statistical modelling, time-series forecasting, and optimization. I am currently learning about large language models (LLMs) and Agentic RAG and building a personal finance management application as a side project.

Apart from my career in data, I am also writing a script to direct my first film. It has been my dream for a very long time. Stay tuned, or not.

**Some things I'm interested in (2025):**

- my family and friends. I love them.
- writing–it transforms me; it lets me get closer to ideas I'd otherwise only scratch the surface of.
- cooking (meditative) especially South Indian, Italian and fusion of both.
- brain storming scripts for my short film
- art, mostly painting, sketching, poster designs, and I make my own t-shirts. 
- technology, AI safety and ethics
- entrepreneurship 
- I like to read science fiction, non-fiction and philosophy. Right now I am reading Byung-Chul Han and Zen.
- psychedelics. They combine some of my long-term interests  - conciousness, self, intelligence, consciousness, philosophy. I believe psychedelic experiences open us up to a wider spectrum of consciousness and shake our belief in solids truths and fixed accounts of reality
- reading books 
- I watch a lot of movies. Some characters and stories shaped my thoughts and being. I owe some to it (you can find all the films I watch on letterboxd)
